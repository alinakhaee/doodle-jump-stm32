# doodle-jump-stm32
This is one of my academic (university) projects which was for the Microcontroller and The Assembly course. <br>
The microcontroller which we were using was STM32F3Discovery board and this project has been designed and tested on this microcontroller. <br>
A sample video has been uploaded in this repository with the name `test.mp4` in order to verify the project's validity and also for usage guidance purposes.
